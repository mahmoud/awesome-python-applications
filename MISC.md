  * License
  * py2/py3/py23
  * Frameworks
  * Target platform
  * Funding model? corporate, nonprofit, and donationware
* What to do with closed-source (dropbox, instagram, etc.)
* CI to check YAML, etc.
* CI to push back generated docs
* Automatic link checking (no duplicates, all resolving)
* Sort keys

## Pages scoured

Hardly the only sources, but mostly so others don't spend their time
mining a spent resource.

* https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/SomeExistingApplications
* https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic
* https://wiki.python.org/moin/Applications
* https://wiki.python.org/moin/WellKnownPythonPrograms
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software#Applications
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyGTK#Notable_applications_that_use_PyGTK
* http://pythonsource.com/
* http://openhub.net/ (python + pyqt4/5 + pygtk tags, pretty noisy dataset)

## Problems with other lists

This is hardly the first attempt to curate a list of Python
software. There are some differences this time around:

1. Objective criteria for inclusion
2. Guaranteed qualititative review (peer review, etc.)
3. Only applications, no frameworks or libraries
4. Links, specifically repo link required, for automated quality control (dead links, dead projects)
5. Structured, for automated consumption and reuse
6. Human-readable docs generated off of structured data
7. Open-source: contribute via PR
8. Tagged, tag aspects (tagsonomy)
9. Destination: Wikidata

Other superceded approaches:

* Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software)
   * No clear curation
   * Unstructured
* Wikidata
   * Lack of browsability
   * Incomplete dataset
   * Hard to curate
* wiki.python.org
   * Too many dead links and projects to count
   * Unstructured
   * Infrequent curation
   * Overinclusivity, minimal criteria
   * Unclear focus of "written in Python" and "supports Python" (in the case of IDEs/plugins)
   * Blurry on open-source and applications
* Awesome Python (https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)
   * 98% libraries and frameworks for developer consumption, not exemplar applications
* http://pythonsource.com/
   * Good, but mingles applications with libraries/frameworks/engines
   * Unclear curatorship
   * No API
* Softpedia
   * All of the above (esp mingling libraries and applications)
* AlternativeTo
   * Pretty nice site focused on applications, but still suffers from
     most of the above, esp the lack of an API.
