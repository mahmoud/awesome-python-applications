# Awesome Python Applications

*Case studies in successfully shipping Python software*

As developers, we spend our days with code. The site you're reading
this on is mostly modules, packages, libraries, frameworks, and the
like. But users see applications.

When building our own applications, open-source Python applications
are a gold mine of practical patterns that we know work together. A
production application is worth a thousand blog posts and Stack
Overflow answers.

This document is an always-growing list of **195**
open-source Python applications arranged by topic, with links to
repositories, docs, and more. If you have one to add or find some
information missing, [please let us
know](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications/issues)!

Read [**the announcement post**](http://sedimental.org/awesome_python_applications.html) to learn more about this list.

<!-- To see this list arranged by which operating systems they
support (and associated discussion), see Platforms, and to see the
list arranged by implementation approach used (and discussion
thereof), see Architectures. -->
